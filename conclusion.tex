\section{Summary}
Our current system for the classification of supernovae can be cumbersome and inefficient as our understanding of these events increases. Type IIb, for example, exhibits features of multiple categories. Still, these categories generally describe features of supernovae that can be gathered at a glance: spectral features, plateau shape, or the steepness of the rise and fall of brightness. For now they are useful. Future discoveries about the explosion mechanisms and progenitors of supernovae may present a new, more direct and intuitive taxonomic system. The astronomy community must be willing to adapt our categories with our understanding as we explore the cosmos.
